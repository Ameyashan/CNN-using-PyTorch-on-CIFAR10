# CNN-using-PyTorch-on-CIFAR10

Implemented a convolutional neural network(CNN) using PyTorch on the CIFAR10 dataset. Here
as well we splited the train data into train and validation sets (10% of data) for hyperparameter tuning.
â€¢ The network contains convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers. 

The convolutional layers would do the feature extraction, but the classification is still being aided by
the fully connected layers
